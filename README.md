# Discord-Advanced-RaidB

A code with several commands and exceptions has three main commands:

- 1- serverlist: Displays the list of servers the bot is in, along with permissions and invite links.
- 2- nuke: Deletes all channels quickly, creates new ones, and spams each one rapidly with the bot and webhooks. It also raises the bot's role when creating it so it can rename all roles with a message provided in the command, skips channels it cannot modify, and logs everything to DM.
- 3- banall: Bans all users in the server, sending a custom message to DM for a "silent raid" and sending the message provided in the command to the DM.
